Failing Cases: These cases contain syntactically correct programs with semantic errors which must be caught by the semantic analyzer step. 
               Hence, these test cases also test symbol table functionality such as scope and variable/return type tracking.

Passing tests: These are split into 2 categories - AST and Symbol Table

AST Test Cases: These programs are both syntactically and semantically correct, and the AST printed into the output must match with the verified one in the out files
array_1D.488                  : test that the AST for 1D arrays is valid
array_2D.488                  : test that the AST for 2D arrays is valid
exit.488                      : test that the AST for the exit statements is valid
expressions.488               : test that the AST for all the expressions is valid
functions.488                 : test that the AST for functions is valid
if_stmt.488                   : test that the AST for if statements is valid
loops.488                     : test that the AST for loops is valid
procedures.488                : test that the AST for procedures is valid
return.488                    : test that the AST for return statements is valid
scope_statements_only.488     : test that the AST for scopes is valid

Symbol Table Test Cases: Thsee programs are both syntactically and semantically correct, and the symbol table must match the expected symbol table in the out files
function_scope.488            : test that the symbol table can handle function scopes
global_scope.488              : test that the symbol table can handle global scopes
loop_scope.488                : test that the symbol table can handle loop scopes
nested_scopes.488             : test that the symbol table can handle nested scopes
shadow_global_scope.488       : test that the symbol table can handle variables shadowing global scope
procedures.488                : test that the symbol table can handle a function and procedure with the same named parameters
shadow_parameters.488         : test that the symbol table can handle shadowing global variables in a function's parameters
shadow_local_variables.488    : test that the symbol table can handle shadowing global variables from a function's local variables
