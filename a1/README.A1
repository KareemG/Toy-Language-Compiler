    Have created 3 different loops, which all utilizes different forms of 
    loops. Two of the loops utilizes the form of "while x do", while one 
    of them uses "repeat until x". One of the loop uses "exit" as a way 
    to escape out of the loop.

    Have created 3 functions and procedures, which are all recursive, or calls 
    recursive function/procedure. 1 function and 1 procedure does not have
    any parameters, whereas the others do. Furthermore, one of each function 
    and procedure is nested inside of another function/procedure.
